Low-frequency signal generator: I designed a square wave signal generator from scratch using OrCAD. I filtered it with a first-order low-pass filter, resulting in a triangular signal. To amplify it, I used a class AB amplifier. To obtain a sinusoidal signal from the square wave, I utilized a second-order low-pass filter, which was then amplified with a class AB amplifier. Finally, I designed the PCB for the generator using OrCAD PCB Editor.
